# SIX Time Series Prediction & Outlier Detection on Anonymised Transaction Dataset

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Description and Business Case
In a business driven by the number of transactions, historical volumes provide a solid foundation for setting future revenue expectations, yet overall trends may hide valuable insights through combining opposing signals. Therefore, an informed analysis of merchant level fluctuations is needed to design a reliable forecasting mechanism that could serve the business purpose.

## Project Goals
Our goal is to analyse the business context behind the provided dataset, propose a
methodology for forecasting future transaction levels and eventually develop and evaluate such a solution. The expectation is to be creative and experiment with different statistical models that could serve the purpose while ensuring the suitability from a business perspective standpoint.
